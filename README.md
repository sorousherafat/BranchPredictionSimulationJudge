# Branch Prediction Simulation Judge
an automatic judge for implementation of different branch prediction algorithms.

this project uses Arash's [branch-predictor-simulator](https://github.com/Arash1381-y/branch-predictor-simulator) at its core to simulate to-be-tested implementation of different branch prediction algorithms.
